    <p> I am a music composer and a sound designer. 
        I have high knowledge in harmony and compositive techniques. Also I have skills 
        on sound creation tools (audio processor, sampling, synth). I like to add that I am a 
        bandoneonist, and percussionist, which give me an advantage finding new specifics
        sounds, and creative musical ideas.
        I have experience working on media productions, recording all kind of music, 
        voiceover, etc. I work mainly on Pro Tools and Cubase, and Sibelius to write music.
        I am a teamplayer, but I donÂ´t have problem working on my own. I never had 
        problems with timelines neither.</p>
